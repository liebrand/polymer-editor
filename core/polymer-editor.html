  Ideally i'd like to use the 'normal' requireJs notation to load the main
  script as follows:

 <script data-main="./polymer-editor" src="../node_modules/requirejs/require.js"></script>

  This would ensure the basePath is automatically set correct. However, this
  does not appaer to work within HTMLImports. RequireJs assumes the script
  is inside the DOM and searches for any script with 'data-main' attrib.
  But the script doesn't appear to be in the DOM? Thus that fails.

  The net result is that i have to create my own requireJs config to set the
  basePath relative to this HTML page. Note: chrome packaged apps will not
  like inline script like this due to their CSP... One could write this
  differently, or perhaps we should make the normal requireJs loader work
  inside HTML imports?

  <script src="../node_modules/requirejs/require.js"></script>
  <script>
    require.config({
      baseUrl: "../../",
    });
  </script>
  <script src="polymer-editor.js"></script>

</polymer-element>
